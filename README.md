Usage
-----

This plugin adds a number of enchantments and 'throwables' to improve the combat experience in Minecraft.

Enchantments:
* Cloak - This enchantment will allow you to go invisibile for a short amount of time while crouching.
    * To activate, sneak. You will be given invisibility, blindness and weakness.
* Hardness - This enchantment is so strong that anyone attacking you takes extra damage to their weapon.
    * Wearing more armour increases this effect.
    * The player must be using a sword for this to work.
    * All zombies spawn with a hardness chestplate so you can test this alone :)

Throwables:
* Flash Bang:
